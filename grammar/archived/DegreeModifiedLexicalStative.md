# DegreeModifiedLexicalStative

## Plain-language claim

Cantonese may instantiate the structural family represented by DegreeModifiedLexicalStative; exact productivity and boundaries require pattern-specific independent evidence.

This is a linguistic claim only to the extent allowed by the status and evidence below. The runtime label is not assumed to be standard linguistic terminology.

## Current status

- Linguistic status: `unsupported_generalization`
- Linguistic confidence: `unsupported`
- Current action: `quarantine_unexercised_runtime_path`
- Productive acceptance eligible: **no**
- Last linguistic review: not recorded

## Sources

### SRC-LAM-LAU-LEE-2024-SEGMENTATION

- Citation: [Lam, Charles, Chaak Ming Lau, and Jackson L. Lee. 2024. Multi-Tiered Cantonese Word Segmentation. Proceedings of LREC-COLING 2024, 11993-12002.](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.1047/)
- Locator: p. 6 section 4.6, degree-modification discussion
- Verification: `VERIFIED_FULL_TEXT`
- What it supports: The paper separately segments degree modifiers such as 好, 幾, and 非常 before adjectives.
- Limit: Do not infer that 好 + 好食 specifically is licensed or pragmatically neutral from the separate general facts alone.

## Native-speaker review

- Independent speaker records: **0**
- Scope: `NOT_ESTABLISHED`
- Surface judgments: 0 total; 0 accepted; 0 rejected.
- Structural-analysis validations: 0.

## Implementation state

- Lifecycle: `runtime_referenced_without_accepted_fixtures`
- Visible/focused tests: `not_assessed_in_current_definition_of_done_review`
- Render review: `not_assessed_in_current_definition_of_done_review`

- Code–documentation comparison: `pending_current_definition_of_done_line_by_line_review`

## Open questions and blockers

- no explicit external claim-source edge
- Runtime metadata and current governance agree in v0.5.184.
- Research question: Which externally documented Cantonese constructions, if any, justify the scope and boundaries currently represented by DegreeModifiedLexicalStative?

## Migration provenance

- Full pre-migration record: `archive/registry-pre-obsidian-v0.5.184/full-construction-registry.json`
- Status migration date: 2026-07-21.
- The frozen JSON preserves the former wide schema; this note is the active authoring record.

## CP040 final reachable-wrapper audit

- Implementation-only reachability: `FRWRAP-004` with `好好食。`
- Protects the current degree 好 + dictionary-backed 好食 tokenization only. It does not settle compositional versus lexical analysis or establish a productive class.
- Its linguistic evidence weight is **0**; reachability does not establish naturalness, productivity, construction identity, or promotion eligibility.

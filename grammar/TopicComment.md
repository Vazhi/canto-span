# TopicComment

## Plain-language claim

Cantonese may instantiate the structural family represented by TopicComment; exact productivity and boundaries require pattern-specific independent evidence.

This is an internal parser representation. It does not independently license a Cantonese construction claim.

## Current status

- Linguistic status: `parser_heuristic`
- Linguistic confidence: `low`
- Current action: `retain_as_representation_only`
- Productive acceptance eligible: **no**
- Last linguistic review: not recorded

## Sources

No pattern-specific external source is currently mapped.

## Native-speaker review

- Independent speaker records: **0**
- Scope: `NOT_ESTABLISHED`
- Surface judgments: 0 total; 0 accepted; 0 rejected.
- Structural-analysis validations: 0.

## Negative and boundary cases

## Implementation state

- Lifecycle: `runtime_referenced_with_accepted_fixtures`
- Visible/focused tests: `not_assessed_in_current_definition_of_done_review`
- Render review: `not_assessed_in_current_definition_of_done_review`
- Held-out evaluation: `NOT_ESTABLISHED`
- Regression: `not_assessed_in_current_definition_of_done_review`
- Code–documentation comparison: `not_applicable_or_internal`

## Open questions and blockers

- internal engineering claim cannot by itself establish Cantonese grammar
- Runtime metadata and current governance agree in v0.5.184.
- Research question: record implementation provenance and keep separate from Cantonese-language evidence

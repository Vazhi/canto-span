# ExperientialQuestion

## Plain-language claim

Cantonese may instantiate the structural family represented by ExperientialQuestion; exact productivity and boundaries require pattern-specific independent evidence.

This is a linguistic claim only to the extent allowed by the status and evidence below. The runtime label is not assumed to be standard linguistic terminology.

## Current status

- Linguistic status: `unsupported_generalization`
- Linguistic confidence: `unsupported`
- Current action: `quarantine_unexercised_runtime_path`
- Productive acceptance eligible: **no**
- Last linguistic review: not recorded

- What it supports: The example combines experiential 過 with final 未 and a question particle.
- Limit: Do not insert 有冇 or reinterpret 未 as simple negation.

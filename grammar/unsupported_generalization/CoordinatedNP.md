# CoordinatedNP

## Plain-language claim

Cantonese may instantiate the structural family represented by CoordinatedNP; exact productivity and boundaries require pattern-specific independent evidence.

This is a linguistic claim only to the extent allowed by the status and evidence below. The runtime label is not assumed to be standard linguistic terminology.

## Current status

- Linguistic status: `unsupported_generalization`
- Linguistic confidence: `unsupported`
- Current action: `quarantine_unexercised_runtime_path`
- Productive acceptance eligible: **no**
- Last linguistic review: not recorded

## Sources

### SRC-WONG-2023-LANGUAGE-SAMPLE

- Citation: [Wong, Anita Mei-Yin. 2023. Understanding Development and Disorder in Cantonese Using Language Sample Analysis. Routledge.](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780367824013)
- Locator: book pp. 17-18; preposition examples 26 and conjunction examples 32-33
- Verification: `VERIFIED_FULL_TEXT`
- What it supports: The same source separately illustrates prepositional/comitative 同 and conjunction 同.
- Limit: Do not classify every 同 between nominals as a coordinator or every 同 before a predicate as conjunction.

- Locator: user PDF conjunction section; examples 我同佢一齊上廣州 and 香港同澳門; 同埋 discussion
- Verification: `VERIFIED_USER_PROVIDED_FULL_TEXT_AND_OFFICIAL_PUBLISHER_METADATA`
- What it supports: The coursebook explicitly describes conjunction 同, gives nominal conjunct examples, and notes the compound 同埋 while preserving use restrictions.
- Limit: Do not use a pedagogical explanation to establish exhaustive distribution or unrestricted adult productivity.

## Implementation state

- Lifecycle: `runtime_referenced_without_accepted_fixtures`
- Visible/focused tests: `not_assessed_in_current_definition_of_done_review`
- Render review: `not_assessed_in_current_definition_of_done_review`
- Held-out evaluation: `NOT_ESTABLISHED`
- Regression: `not_assessed_in_current_definition_of_done_review`
- Code–documentation comparison: `pending_current_definition_of_done_line_by_line_review`

## Open questions and blockers

- no explicit external claim-source edge
- Runtime metadata and current governance agree in v0.5.184.
- Research question: Which externally documented Cantonese constructions, if any, justify the scope and boundaries currently represented by CoordinatedNP?

## Related constructions

- [[AssociativeNP]]

## Migration provenance

- Full pre-migration record: `archive/registry-pre-obsidian-v0.5.184/full-construction-registry.json`
- Status migration date: 2026-07-21.
- The frozen JSON preserves the former wide schema; this note is the active authoring record.

## Evidence and ontology closure guidance

- Review date: 2026-07-23
- Ontology class: Cantonese-language profile requiring narrow evidence-faithful scope
- Research finding: Current sources support overt NP coordination with `同`/`同埋`; newer Chan 2024 provides a dedicated Sinitic coordination study. `同` also has comitative/coverb uses.
- Recommended disposition: Retain simple overt coordination in the NP subsystem; add explicit comitative and non-NP guards. Extend to nested coordination only through separate rules.
- Retirement safeguard: Do not retire before checking whether all current outputs can be represented by the NP coordination subsystem without losing conjunct boundaries.
- Status effect: This note-only research sweep does not promote or retire the label. The current status remains unchanged until runtime, contract, and release records are reconciled in the implementation track.

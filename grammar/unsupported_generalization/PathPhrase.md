# PathPhrase

## Plain-language claim

Cantonese may instantiate the structural family represented by PathPhrase; exact productivity and boundaries require pattern-specific independent evidence.

This is a linguistic claim only to the extent allowed by the status and evidence below. The runtime label is not assumed to be standard linguistic terminology.

## Current status

- Linguistic status: `unsupported_generalization`
- Linguistic confidence: `unsupported`
- Current action: `quarantine_and_research_before_retention`
- Productive acceptance eligible: **no**
- Last linguistic review: not recorded

## Sources

### SRC-LEUNG-2014-COVERBS

- Citation: [Leung, H. H. 2014. Cantonese Coverbs: A Syntactic Reanalysis. MA qualifying paper, University of California, Berkeley.](https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~herman/documents/CantoneseCoverbs_MAPaper_Leung.pdf)
- Locator: pp. 1-3
- Verification: `VERIFIED_FULL_TEXT_CORROBORATIVE`
- What it supports: The paper lists 向 as a directional coverb and places coverb phrases before the main verb.
- Limit: Do not use an unpublished analysis as sole evidence or expand 向 to every noun and verb.

### SRC-YIP-MATTHEWS-2000-BASIC

- Citation: [Yip, V. and Matthews, S. 2000. Basic Cantonese: A Grammar and Workbook. London/New York: Routledge.](https://culturequote.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cantonese-basic.pdf)
- Locator: PDF pp. 77 and 80; Unit 13
- Verification: `VERIFIED_FULL_TEXT`
- What it supports: The reference grammar assigns distinct functions to 向 toward and 經 via, and treats goal and source separately.
- Limit: Do not use PathPhrase as if all spatial relations were interchangeable.

## Native-speaker review

- Independent speaker records: **1**
- Scope: `ONE_SPEAKER_SENTENCE_NATURALNESS_ONLY_NOT_ANALYSIS_VALIDATION`
- Surface judgments: 1 total; 1 accepted; 0 rejected.
- Structural-analysis validations: 0.

## Negative and boundary cases

## Implementation state

- Lifecycle: `runtime_referenced_with_accepted_fixtures`
- Visible/focused tests: `not_assessed_in_current_definition_of_done_review`
- Render review: `not_assessed_in_current_definition_of_done_review`
- Held-out evaluation: `NOT_ESTABLISHED`
- Regression: `not_assessed_in_current_definition_of_done_review`
- Code–documentation comparison: `pending_current_definition_of_done_line_by_line_review`

## Open questions and blockers

- no explicit external claim-source edge
- Runtime metadata and current governance agree in v0.5.184.
- Research question: Which externally documented Cantonese constructions, if any, justify the scope and boundaries currently represented by PathPhrase?

## Migration provenance

- Full pre-migration record: `archive/registry-pre-obsidian-v0.5.184/full-construction-registry.json`
- Status migration date: 2026-07-21.
- The frozen JSON preserves the former wide schema; this note is the active authoring record.

## Evidence and ontology closure guidance

- Review date: 2026-07-23
- Ontology class: Cantonese-language profile requiring narrow evidence-faithful scope
- Research finding: `SRC-LEUNG-2014-COVERBS`; `SRC-YIP-MATTHEWS-2000-BASIC`. Sources distinguish `向` toward, `經` via, source, and goal rather than one interchangeable path category.
- Recommended disposition: Replace catch-all scope with typed orientation, route, source, and goal relations; likely shared spatial subsystem.
- Retirement safeguard: Do not retire before mapping current surfaces to their exact spatial relation and position.
- Status effect: This note-only research sweep does not promote or retire the label. The current status remains unchanged until runtime, contract, and release records are reconciled in the implementation track.
